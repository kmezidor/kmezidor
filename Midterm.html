Place the bowl in the fridge and allow the “egg” to gel for about 5 minutes.</li><li>Once your egg is ready, use a hand mixer and whisk the flax egg until slightly frothy. Add in the peanut butter, maple syrup, baking powder and optional cinnamon and mix until combined.Fold in the chocolate chips.</li><li>Drop the batter in 1.5 tablespoon amounts onto your baking sheets.

Pulse until they are half crumbly and half small pieces, about 5-6 rounds. You basically don’t want large chunks of pretzel, but you don’t want teeny tiny crumbs either. Using the markings on the outside of the blender (or a measuring cup), measure out 1/2 cup of crushed pretzels. Repeat this process with more pretzels if you don’t quite reach 1/2 cup. Add the pretzels to the bowl with Team Wet.</li><li>Without rinsing out the blender, add the oats, shredded coconut and flaxseed. Pulse until the oats and coconut are crumbled together in small pieces, about 5-6 rounds. Pour Team Dry into the stand mixer.</li><li>Using the paddle attachment, turn the mixer on low and mix all the ingredients together until they are well combined and sticky.</li><li>Using a cookie scoop, scoop out balls onto a cookie sheet. When the cookie sheet is full, pick up each ball with your hands, squish the contents together and shape into a ball. Place the ball back onto the cookie sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.</li><li>Store in the fridge or freezer, although the freezer is preferred if you’ll be packing these in lunches.</li></ol><img src='Energy Bites.jpeg'>";
